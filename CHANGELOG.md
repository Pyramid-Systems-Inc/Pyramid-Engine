## [0.3.9] - 2025-06-30

### Added

  - Configurable console and file logging levels (runtime adjustable)
  - Source location tracking with file, function, and line number information
  - Structured logging support with key-value pairs for analytics
  - Multiple logging interfaces:
    - C-style variadic logging: `PYRAMID_LOG_INFO("Message: ", value)`
    - Stream-style logging: `PYRAMID_INFO_STREAM() << "Message: " << value`
    - Structured logging: `PYRAMID_LOG_STRUCTURED(level, message, fields)`
  - Enhanced assertion macros with automatic logging integration
  - Performance optimizations with early exit filtering and local buffers
  - Configurable timestamp formats with millisecond precision

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Logging system moved from `Engine/Core/` to `Engine/Utils/`
  - Old include: `#include <Pyramid/Core/Log.hpp>` (no longer exists)
  - New include: `#include <Pyramid/Util/Log.hpp>`
  - All logging functionality now in `Pyramid::Util` namespace
- All engine components updated to use new Utils-based logging system
- Logging macros maintain same interface but now provide enhanced functionality
- BasicGame example updated to demonstrate new logging configuration options

### Removed
- Old Core-based logging system completely removed

- Legacy `Pyramid::Log` namespace no longer available

### Fixed
- Thread safety issues in logging system resolved
- Deadlock prevention in multi-threaded logging scenarios
- Race conditions in log level checking eliminated
- Memory management improved with local buffer usage

### Migration Guide
For users upgrading from previous versions:
1. Update include statements: `#include <Pyramid/Core/Log.hpp>` â†’ `#include <Pyramid/Util/Log.hpp>`
2. Existing logging calls continue to work without changes
3. Optionally configure enhanced features:
   ```cpp
   Pyramid::Util::LoggerConfig config;
   config.enableFile = true;
   config.logFilePath = "your_game.log";
   PYRAMID_CONFIGURE_LOGGER(config);
   ```
4. Consider using new structured logging for analytics and debugging

## [0.3.8] - 2025-05-07

### Added
- `IGraphicsDevice::CreateShader()` method and `OpenGLDevice` implementation for shader program creation.
- `BufferLayout` system (`BufferLayout.hpp`, `BufferElement`, `ShaderDataType`) for defining vertex attribute layouts.
- `IVertexArray::AddVertexBuffer` now accepts a `BufferLayout` to configure vertex attributes.
- Protected `Game::GetGraphicsDevice()` accessor for derived game classes.
- Implemented uniform setting methods (`SetUniformInt`, `SetUniformFloat*`, `SetUniformMat*`) in `IShader` and `OpenGLShader`.
- `OpenGLShader` now caches uniform locations.
- Added basic Texture System:
    - `ITexture`, `ITexture2D` interfaces (`Texture.hpp`).
    - `OpenGLTexture2D` implementation using `stb_image` for loading (`OpenGLTexture.hpp`, `OpenGLTexture.cpp`).
    - `TextureSpecification` struct and related enums.
    - Static `ITexture2D::Create` factory methods (`Texture.cpp`).
    - `IGraphicsDevice::CreateTexture2D` methods added and implemented for OpenGL.
- Added basic Logging system (`Log.hpp` with `PYRAMID_LOG_*` macros).
- Added basic Assertion system (`Log.hpp` with `PYRAMID_ASSERT` / `PYRAMID_CORE_ASSERT` macros).
- `BasicGame` example updated to load and render a textured triangle, modulated by the dynamic uniform tint.

### Changed
- Integrated logging macros into `Game.cpp`, `OpenGLShader.cpp`, `OpenGLTexture.cpp`, `BasicGame.cpp`.
- Integrated assertion macros into `Game.cpp`.
- Refactored `OpenGLDevice` to accept a `Window*` dependency via constructor, decoupling it from direct `Win32OpenGLWindow` instantiation.
- `Game` class now owns the `Window` instance (`std::unique_ptr<Window> m_window`).
- `Game` constructor now creates the `Window` and passes it to `IGraphicsDevice::Create`.
- `OpenGLVertexArray.cpp` updated to use `BufferLayout` for `glVertexAttribPointer` setup.

### Fixed
- `Game::run()` loop now correctly processes window messages (`m_window->ProcessMessages()`), resolving issues with window not appearing or becoming unresponsive.
- `Game::onCreate()` now explicitly initializes the graphics device (`m_graphicsDevice->Initialize()`) and checks for success before starting the game loop.
- `Win32OpenGLWindow::Initialize` now correctly uses the provided `title` parameter instead of a hardcoded one.
- Removed unnecessary `#include <windows.h>` from `Engine/Core/source/Game.cpp`.
- Made graphics device creation in `Game::Game()` constructor consistently use the `IGraphicsDevice::Create()` factory.
