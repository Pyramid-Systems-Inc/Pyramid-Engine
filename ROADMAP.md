    - [~] Uniform buffer support (Basic `glUniform*` support added; true Uniform Buffer Objects (UBOs) still pending)
    - [ ] Multiple shader programs (Supported by creating multiple IShader instances, advanced management pending)
  - [X] Texture system implementation (2D texture loading with custom Pyramid image loader supporting all major formats)
    - [X] Custom Pyramid::Util::Image loader (Complete: TGA, BMP, PNG, and JPEG support)
    - [X] Integration with OpenGL texture pipeline (replaced stb_image dependency)
    - [X] PNG support with DEFLATE decompression (Phase 2 complete: full PNG implementation)
